# Tresure_Island
Inspired from a treasure island book, It is a simple text based game to find a treasure. able to create thanks to MLH live session.

## What it does
1. It asked for user input to **left** or **right**. After that on the user choice go to next stage of game.
2. From second stage user get 3 option to choose the door to get to trasure only one of the door is right option.Let Have a Fun!! 😁🎯.

## How we built it
By the help of python I able to create the game, for  different case use the if elseif and else to go through different situation.
Get the treasure chest ascii art from [ASCII ART](https://ascii.co.uk/art/treasure).

## What we learned
Thanks to MLH's GHW I got an opportunity to built the Text-based adventure game. Hope to learn  got more.

## What's next for Tresure_Island
It has many possibilites to develope in future, may able to create more complex gaming adventure with better story arc.
